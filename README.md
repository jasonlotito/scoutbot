## üì¢ Advertisement System

The bot includes an intelligent advertisement system that promotes the blackjack game automatically:

### Features
- **Smart Timing**: Only sends ads after a configurable interval AND minimum chat activity
- **Rotating Messages**: Multiple ad messages that rotate to keep chat fresh
- **Per-Channel Tracking**: Independent tracking for each channel
- **Slow Chat Protection**: Requires minimum messages before sending ads (prevents spam)
- **Desktop Integration**: Configure through the desktop app settings

### Configuration Options
Add these to your `.env` file:
```env
# Advertisement Settings (optional)
AD_ENABLED=true                 # Enable/disable ads (default: true)
AD_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5          # Minutes between ads (default: 5)
AD_MIN_MESSAGES=10             # Min messages required (default: 10)
```

### How It Works
1. Bot tracks all chat messages per channel
2. After X minutes AND Y messages since last ad, sends an advertisement
3. Rotates through different promotional messages
4. Resets message counter after each ad
5. Respects slow chats by requiring minimum activity level

### Sample Advertisement Messages
- üÉè Want to play blackjack? Type !deal to start a game!
- üé≤ Ready for some blackjack action? Use !deal to start!
- ‚ô†Ô∏è Blackjack time! Start with !deal, join with !join!
- üéØ Test your luck at blackjack! Commands: !deal, !join, !hit, !stand

## How to Play

### Starting a Game
1. Any viewer types `!deal` to start a new game
2. Other viewers can type `!join` to join (up to 6 players total)
3. Game automatically starts after 30 seconds or when 6 players join

### Playing Your Hand
- Type `!hit` to take another card
- Type `!stand` to keep your current hand
- If you go over 21, you automatically bust
- If you get exactly 21 with your first 2 cards, that's blackjack!

### Dealer Turn
- After all players finish (or 60 seconds pass), the dealer plays automatically
- Dealer hits on 16 and stands on 17
- Results are announced automatically

### Winning
- **Win**: Your hand beats the dealer's hand without busting
- **Lose**: You bust or dealer's hand beats yours
- **Push**: You and dealer have the same value (tie)

## Game Rules

- **Card Values**: 
  - Number cards (2-10): Face value
  - Face cards (J, Q, K): 10 points
  - Aces: 11 points (automatically becomes 1 if needed to avoid busting)
- **Blackjack**: 21 with exactly 2 cards
- **Bust**: Hand value over 21 (automatic loss)
- **Dealer Rules**: Hits on 16, stands on 17

## Configuration

The bot can be customized by modifying the game settings in `src/blackjack.js`:

- `maxPlayers`: Maximum players per game (default: 6)
- `dealTimeoutMs`: Time to wait before auto-starting (default: 30 seconds)
- `dealerDelayMs`: Delay before dealer plays (default: 5 seconds)

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Connect
- Check your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Verify your Access Token has the required scopes (`chat:read`, `chat:edit`)
- Make sure channel names don't include the `#` symbol
- Ensure your Twitch application is properly configured

### Commands Not Working
- Ensure commands start with `!` (exclamation mark)
- Check that the bot has joined the channel
- Verify the bot account isn't banned or timed out

### Game Issues
- Use `!reset` (mods only) to reset a stuck game
- Check console logs for error messages
- Restart the bot if needed
